### Limitations
Function cannot have anymore or less than 2 values in each set.

Function only supports x as a variable and can't have multiple variables.

The algebraic functions as of now will only be able to be typed as (ax,b)(c,d) rather than (ax + b)(c - d) right now however I may make the latter supported eventually.

### TODO
Working on finishing Algebraic Foiling and merging values with the same exponents.
Add support for different variables than x.
