# Foiling Project
Just a simple challenge between me and a friend to make a foiling system.
My friends repo can be found at [Aethese/Foiling](https://github.com/Aethese/Foiling)

Currently, it supports basic foiling but im working on support for complex foiling which includes variables.

## Limitations
* Algebraic functions are not supported yet, but I am working on that. The algebraic functions, as of now, will only be able to be typed as `(ax,b)(c,d)` rather than `(ax + b)(c - d)` right now, however I may make the latter supported eventually.

* Only supports 2 values in each set of parentheses.

* It doesn't combine similar values yet, so that may also be fixed.

# Exclaimer
This code **definitely** can be cleaned up and be made better, so all the code right now is temporary and will be cleaned up eventually *(if I have the motivation to)*.
